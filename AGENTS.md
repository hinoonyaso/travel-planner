# TripFit

Fine-tunes a model with LoRA/QLoRA to turn Busan hotel, restaurant, and
attraction reviews into structured Context / Aspect / Attribute / Sentiment /
Evidence records, and compares Base, LoRA, and QLoRA on the same data.
Python >= 3.12, managed with `uv` from the repository root; package code lives in
`model/src/travel_planner/`. Loading a model, training, and applying an adapter are
separate steps that each need an explicit request.

`README.md` defines the current scope. `docs/init-plan.md` describes an earlier
itinerary-planner design; where the two disagree, follow `README.md`.

## Working agreement

- A prompt that asks how, why, or which is better is a **discussion**. Explain the
  proposed solution first; change code only after explicit acceptance.
- Keep the diff inside the requested scope. No drive-by formatting, no unrelated
  refactoring.
- Investigate a failure's root cause before retrying it.
- Add dependencies with `uv add`, so `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` change together.
- **Explain core terms every time:** Whenever a response introduces a technical term or core concept the user may not know, briefly define it in 1–2 sentences before moving on. Do not assume the term is familiar because it appeared earlier in the conversation. Prefix the explanation with `💡` (for example, `💡 LoRA: 원본 모델 가중치는 고정한 채 작은 저랭크 행렬만 학습해 모델을 조정하는 기법입니다.`).

## MVP scope

- In scope: review extraction, per-place Review Profiles aggregated in
  Python/SQL, and the Base vs LoRA vs QLoRA comparison.
- Future extensions, built only on explicit request: itinerary generation,
  location and travel-time calculation (Google Maps API), the clarifying-question
  planner, and a Validator.
- TourAPI place data is trusted fact. Keep it with the place, and derive a label
  from it where the review is silent: a place's type tells indoor or outdoor
  even without an explicit field.

## Data invariants

- Output shape: `{"traveler_context": [...], "aspects": [{"category",
  "attribute", "sentiment", "evidence"}]}`. `evidence` is a verbatim span of the
  review, or, for a label derived from place facts, the fact it rests on, written
  `place:<field>=<value>` (e.g. `place:class_code=NA020100`). A model trained on
  place-derived labels gets those facts in its input too.
- `datas/common/schema.py` holds the place record shape, the aspects, and their allowed values;
  `docs/annotation-guideline.md` holds the labeling rules.
- **Gold** is data a person compared against the source and approved, whoever
  drafted it. **Silver** is Teacher-LLM output that passed only automatic checks
  (JSON, allowed aspect, attribute/sentiment values, evidence found in the review
  or the cited place fact, required fields). Keep the tier on every record.
- The test set is Gold only and shared by every experiment: Gold-only vs
  Gold + Silver, and Base vs LoRA vs QLoRA on the same task, labels, and split.
- Mark synthetic reviews as synthetic; they never count as real user reviews.
- For split policy, scoring thresholds, and training hyperparameters, propose a
  default with its reasoning and let the user confirm it.

## Verification

No test suite or linter is configured yet. Until one is, run the changed code
with `uv run` and report what you ran and its output.

## Commits

Follow the `commit` skill.
